Shakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground, eventually branching off as a solo artist.[11][12][13] The themes of most of Shakur's songs revolved around the violence and hardship in inner cities, racism and other social problems. Both of his parents and several other people in his family were members of the Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs.

During the latter part of his career, Shakur was a vocal participant in the so-called East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, becoming involved in conflicts with other rappers, producers and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and the label Bad Boy Records.[14]

On September 7, 1996, Shakur was murdered in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada.[15] He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died six days later.[16]
